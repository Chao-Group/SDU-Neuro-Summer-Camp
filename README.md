## Task 1 Medical Segmentation on 2D BraTS
*Instructor*: Hao Chen (hc666@cam.ac.uk)

In this task, we focus on performing medical image segmentation using 2D slices from the BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset. The goal is to accurately segment tumor regions from MRI scans using deep learning techniques. This task provides a practical introduction to medical image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a real-world neuroimaging context.

## Task 4 Super-resolution reconstruction of spatial transcriptomics
*Instructor*: Hanyu Liu(liu_han-yu@foxmail.com) & Xiaoyang Li(m18233511508@outlook.com)
In this task, we implemented super-resolution reconstruction of spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. The main goal is to reconstruct low-resolution gene expression data into high-resolution gene expression images. The project compares three different deep learning models: Advanced U-Net, TESLA, and HSG. We integrate the simplified model and training and testing codes into this ipynb file, and add a simple visualization.
