## Task 1 Medical Segmentation on 2D BraTS
*Instructor*: Hao Chen (hc666@cam.ac.uk)

In this task, we focus on performing medical image segmentation using 2D slices from the BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset. The goal is to accurately segment tumor regions from MRI scans using deep learning techniques. This task provides a practical introduction to medical image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a real-world neuroimaging context.
