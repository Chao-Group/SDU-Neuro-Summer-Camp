## Task 1 Medical Segmentation on 2D BraTS
*Instructor*: Hao Chen (hc666@cam.ac.uk)

In this task, we focus on performing medical image segmentation using 2D slices from the BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset. The goal is to accurately segment tumor regions from MRI scans using deep learning techniques. This task provides a practical introduction to medical image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a real-world neuroimaging context.


## Task 2 Medical Image Generation（Translation） on 2D BraTS(TCGA_LGG_GBM)
*Instructor*: Yifan Chen (yc681@cam.ac.uk)

In this task, we focus on medical image generation using paired 2D slices from the BraTS 2017 dataset. The objective is to translate between different MRI modalities (T1, T1ce, T2, and FLAIR) using deep learning-based image-to-image translation techniques. This task offers a hands-on introduction to neuroimaging data preprocessing, modality-to-modality synthesis, and evaluation of generated images, providing insight into practical applications of generative models in medical imaging.
