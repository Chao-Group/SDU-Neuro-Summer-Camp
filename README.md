## Task 1 Medical Segmentation on 2D BraTS
*Instructor*: Hao Chen (hc666@cam.ac.uk)

In this task, we focus on performing medical image segmentation using 2D slices from the BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset. The goal is to accurately segment tumor regions from MRI scans using deep learning techniques. This task provides a practical introduction to medical image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a real-world neuroimaging context.

## Task 3 Brain Age Estimation via Multimodal Brain Networks
*Instructor*: Jianwei Chen (2644055@dundee.ac.uk)

In this task, we aim to predict brain age using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on multimodal brain connectivity from the NKI-Rockland dataset. The task involves two key steps: (1) preprocessing structural (DTI) and functional (rs-fMRI) MRI data to construct individual brain networks, and (2) building an end-to-end GNN framework to extract graph representations for brain age extimation. This provides hands-on experience in multimodal neuroimaging analysis and graph-based deep learning.

## Task 5 Super-resolution reconstruction of spatial transcriptomics
*Instructor*: Hanyu Liu(liu_han-yu@foxmail.com) & Xiaoyang Li(m18233511508@outlook.com)
In this task, we implemented super-resolution reconstruction of spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. The main goal is to reconstruct low-resolution gene expression data into high-resolution gene expression images. The project compares three different deep learning models: Advanced U-Net, TESLA, and HSG. We integrate the simplified model and training and testing codes into this ipynb file, and add a simple visualization.
